# Auto-title demo

This Storybook instance is intentionally configured with `withFlattenedAutoTitles()`.

Check the sidebar entry for:

- `stories/examples/ui/button/icon-button.stories.ts`

It is rendered as a cleaner title path instead of raw file segments.

You can compare this repository's Storybook config in `.storybook/main.ts`.
